\title{Identify seed compounds of each organism}
\usage{
getSeedSets(g, threshold = 0.2)
}
\arguments{
\item{g,}{an igraph object which represents a given organism-specific metaboliic network}

\item{threshold,}{numeric constant ranges from 0 to 1, default is 0.2.}
}
\value{
seed set compounds of the given organism-specific metabolic network
}
\description{
Detect a given metabolic network and idendity the seed compounds of each organism
}
\details{
All the compound in the same source SCC all equally to be included in the seed set,
each of these compounds was assigned a confidence level, C=1/(size of souce SCC), denoting
the compounds probability of being a seed. This threshold was used to determin whether a
compound should be a seed. 0.2 is recommended.
