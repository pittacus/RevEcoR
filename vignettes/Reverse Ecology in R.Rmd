## ReverseEcologyR -- Reverse ecology linking organism(s) and their environments

### Introduction

The struction of complex biological systems relects not only their function but
also into the habitates in which they envoled and are adapted to. Reverse 
Ecology- an emerging new frontier in Evolutionary Sysmtems biology at the 
interface of computational biology, genomics and environmental science, which 
uses population genomics to study ecology with no a priori assumptions about the
organism(s) under consideration. This term was suggested by [Li *et al.* 2008](#ref1) 
during a conference on ecological genomics in Christchurch, New Zealand. It 
facilitates the translation of high through genomic data into large scale 
ecological data, and utilizes system-based method to obtain novel insights of 
pooly characterized microorganisms and relationships between microorgasnims or 
their environments in a superorganism.Traditional approach, however, can only 
applied to a small scale and for ralatively well-studied systems.

The crucial premise of Reverse Ecology is that genomic information can be 
converted into ecological information. Metabolism linking  miroorgasnim  with 
the biochemical environmnet acrossing compound exchanges: import of exogenous 
compounds and impact the composition of its environment via secretion of other 
compounds.
